 Pastures Integration
---

A custom-made redbot cog for connecting the greener pastures minecraft server and discord servers.

This cog provides 2 functions:
- The ability to see currently online players via a live-updating message embed
- The ability to do _one-click_ whitelisting of users by adding a 👍 emote to a message containing a username.

_This cog isn't really meant for public consumption, all the branding is currently baked into the main embed function, with no direct way of editing it!_
