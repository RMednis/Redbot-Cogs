# VX-er
Offers the option to convert twitter and tiktok links into vxtiktok/vxtwitter links.
This means that you can watch the video(s) without leaving the app.

Every time a twitter or tiktok link is posted, the bot will react to it. 
Clicking the reaction will send a message with the link swapped out.
