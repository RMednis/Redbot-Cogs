## TTS Engine

A better way of using Text to Speech from discord for our no-mic friends.
Uses StreamElements API to be able to generate TTS using the voices of Brian, Amy, and many others.

Automatically reads out any messages send in select channels of a user has enabled TTS, no need to do 
`/tts` anymore and struggle with awful Microsoft system localised voices.

## Timezones

Simplifies time planning in multinational/continent servers by allowing users to set their timezone and 
view the time in other user's timezones.

Allows you to see the times in any of the set users timezones, convert times between timezones, see the difference
between 2 timezones, and view the current time in a timezone. Offers a persistent message that shows the current time
in the set timezone of the users who have enabled it. And dynamic conversion between am/pc and 24 hour time.
