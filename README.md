# Med's Redbot Cogs
![](logo2.png)

Random cogs and things for RedBot V3... Mainly meant for greener pastures server's but can be used in any small-meduim server :D
> These cogs are mainly as-is and have only been lightly tested. If you run into issues, feel free to open an issue,
> I cannot guarantee any fixes...

## Pastures Integration

Mincecraft server status, online player list, and whitelisting cog for redbot using an rcon connection.
Supports custom, persistent embeds that auto update with the currently online players, as well as a lot of other features.

> [!WARNING]  
> This cog works on Redbot 3.5 but has not been updated to use slash commands

> More information in `pastures_integration/README.md`

## TTS Engine

A better way of using Text to Speech from discord for our no-mic friends.
Uses Streamelements API to be able to generate TTS using the voices of Brian, Amy, and many others.

Automatically reads out any messages send in select channels of a user has enabled TTS, no need to do 
`/tts` anymore and struggle with awful Microsoft system localised voices.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This cog only uses slash commands!
